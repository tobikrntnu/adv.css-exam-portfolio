            <p class="reflection__text">
                The feedback on this project was mostly positive. It was described as a 
                high-quality project with a clear structure and good design. However, 
                the text was a bit small. The animations were nice and well done.
            </p>
            <p class="reflection__text">
                I decided to keep the poster as it was. I did not see any visual improvements 
                that i could make to the elements, so I decided to keep it. For the text, I 
                tried a lot of different things. I tried using clamps, which did not work, 
                possibly because the poster was not the full width so the text did not actually 
                resize when the poster scaled. I also tried using media queries, but 
                that did not work for the same reason, so I tried container queries. 
                That did not work, because the code did not actually edit the text size when 
                the poster scaled. 
            </p>
            <p class="reflection__text">
                This process taught me a lot about how responsive techniques depend on how a 
                layout is structured and how elements relate to their containers. I also 
                learned a lot about placing and animating elements create a visual 
                togetherness, draw attention and help convey the message of the design. 
                I have gained a deeper understanding, and have the knowledge to approach a 
                project like this in the future.

            <h3 class="reflection__subheader">General reflection and learning outcomes</h3>
            <p class="reflection__text">
                Through this project, I learned a lot about working with SVGs, both in creating 
                scalable graphics and animating them using CSS and SVG-specific attributes. I 
                implemented animations such as swing, fade, spin and flip to highlight and draw
                attention to the specific elements without changing and overwhelming the overall design. 
                This has helped me understand how animations can be used to visually enhance interest 
                while preserving clarity and the togetherness of the poster. 
            </p>
            <p class="reflection__text">
                A major technical challenge was maintaining the posters aspect ratio across 
                different poster sizes while still ensuring the layout and content remained the 
                same. It helped me create a poster that remained accessible and well-proportioned. 
                By extracting the elements in Adobe Illustrator and inserting them into the project 
                with the correct retio aspect and separate some elements to make animations that fit 
                the poster the best. This has strengthened my ability to combine different design 
                methods and code to achieve visual accuracy. 
            </p>
            <p class="reflection__text">
                Even though I didn't manage to implement fluid typography or container-based 
                responsiveness for the text, the process helped me learn a lot about 
                responsive design and animations. I have gained a stronger appreciation for 
                how animations, modular scales and fluid typography. I also learned more about 
                how small design choices can significantly affect user experience. In the future, 
                it will be easier to implement fluid typography and responsive text solutions, 
                because I can make them scale as the website is scaled. 
            </p>
            <p class="reflection__text">
                I also kept improving on the learning outcomes of project 1. I used BEM naming 
                to help me keep my code structured, and styled it using SCSS to nest together 
                the different elements based on where they would be placed (like all elements 
                on the blue background would be grouped together). This helped me a lot with 
                nesting the elements and styling them in a more modular way. It also helped me 
                maintain clarity and consistency in my styling, while also making the code 
                easier to manage. I did not separate the different files because I felt like 
                it was the easiest for a project of this scope and size. For me, it was the 
                most efficient approach, even though I understand that in larger projects, 
                separating the different parts into files would be more scalable and maintainable.
