        <p class="description__text">
          For this website, I decided to use the reset css. I know that on the
          website it says that it is not recommended to use in its unaltered
          state, but i decided to keep the whole thing because I didn't know
          what to take away, and therefore kept it whole.
        </p>
        <p class="description__text">
          I have commented in the code where I have used logical properties
          instead of traditional directional properties.
        </p>
        <p class="description__text">
          I didn't find a scss validator, but I validated the css files

        <h2 class="description__subtitle">BEM methodology</h2>
        <p class="description__text">
          I used BEM methodology to structure my code to make it easier to
          manage and scale, and used BEM naming conventions. I tried to use this
          to identify the block element first, and then the elements of the
          block and if there were any modifiers to use.
        </p>
        <p class="description__text">
          On the reviews, I made a "card" block. I then identified elements that
          i wanted on the card, such as a name, stars and text. I then used BEM
          naming methodology and named the elements by doing block__element. In
          addition to this, I tried to separate a card by using a modifier. I
          tried the first card as primary and the rest as secondary. There were
          no meaningful use for this, but i wanted to try it to see how it
          worked.
        </p>
        <p class="description__text">
          This is the same structure i followed with my header, footer, buttons
          and all the other sections of my website.

        <h2 class="description__subtitle">Structure of files</h2>
        <p class="description__text">
          I started by creating an images folder, and made another folder for
          each html page to make it easier to separate if I were to add many
          more pages to the website. I also added a styles folder, and then I
          added the sub folders inside. The sub folders i decided to add were:
          base, components, layout, pages and utilities. Inside the base folder,
          I added a global.scss and a reset.scss file. As explained earlier, I
          kept the reset file as it was, and in my global.scss file, I hade some
          global rules, an axiom and my variables.
        </p>
        <p class="description__text">
          In my components folder, I added scss pages for the components I have
          used on the website, such as buttons, card and navigation. In my
          layout folder, I have a flex.scss file and a grid.scss file where I
          have the grid and flex properties separated from the rest of the css
          styling to separate concerns and make it easier to find and change. In
          the pages folder, I have page specific styling, and i have a utilities
          folder, but I have not used any helper classes or such, so there are
          no pages in this folder, but I have it in the project as good practice
          for future projects where i would need it.

        <h2 class="description__subtitle">Stack and Cover layout</h2>
        <p class="description__text">
          I found this part a little difficult to understand, but i tried to use
          the cover layout for the hero section with the image of the watches. I
          copied a bit of code from "Every Layout" and used it on the image to
          cover the whole width and automatically rescale when the viewport gets
          smaller or bigger. I did the same with the stack layout, and used that
          on the features section to create the layout

          Responsiveness without Media queries
        </h2>
        <p class="description__text">
          I have not used any media queries, and yet the website is responsive.
          One thing I have done is inside ".review__div", where I have added
          this: "grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(250px,1fr));"
          Another thing I have done is added max-width properties in the
          global.scss file to ensure that there are no overflow. I have also
          used the cover and stack layout provided by "Every Layout", and these
          are responsive without having to use media queries.
