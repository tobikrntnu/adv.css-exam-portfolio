            <h3 class="reflection__subheader">Feedback</h3>
            <p class="reflection__text">
                I recieved feedback on my first task that helped me a lot and guided 
                me to major improvements in my coding practices and project organization. The first point
                was about the way i managed my SASS files. Originally, I had all my separate SASS files 
                linked individually, which made the project harder to maintain and added several unneeded files. 
                The first part of the feedback to make all SASS files into partials, and imported them all 
                into one main.scss file, so that I only needed to compile that one scss file. After implementing 
                this change, I noticed that i saved time and reduced a lot of confusion because of the amount of 
                files in the project. 
            </p>
            <p class="reflection__text">
                The second piece of feedback was about removing commented-out or unused code. I had some pieces of 
                commented out code that I left in because I used them in earlier versions, and kept them "just in case".
                This cluttered some of my files, and made the SASS harder to read. Cleaning this out made my code cleaner. 
                More importantly, it helped me develop a habit of keeping my code clean and neat, which is very important 
                when my projects grow and when working in teams.
            </p>
            <p class="reflection__text">
                The third, was that the website seemed unfinished, and in need of some refinement to make it come together 
                cohesively. The first website had little actual content. I added two sections to the website, a specs table 
                and a key features section. Two of the sections in the website were copied over from "Every Layout" like 
                described in the task description, so I decided to keep them in the last version of the website as well. 
                I focused on adding relevant sections and cleaned up some of the other parts of the website. I worked on 
                enhancing the general website to make it visually balanced, while focusing on the actual purpose of the task.

            <h3 class="reflection__subheader">General Reflection and learning outcomes</h3>
            <div>
                <h4 class="reflection__subheader">BEM methodology</h4>
                <p class="reflection__text">
                    The focus on the first task was learning about key concepts like SASS, BEM methodology, scalability and separation of concerns. 
                    One of the most impactful learning concepts was the BEM (Block, element, modifier) naming methodology. This 
                    fundamentally changed how I view and write HTML and CSS code. I start by identifying the block, and then the 
                    elements within that block and possible modifiers for the given elements. Before learning about this, my HTML 
                    and CSS was inconsistent and difficult to maintain and scale. I would often encounter problems with 
                    what element I wanted to style, conflicting class names and styling that were hard to track and identify, 
                    especially as the projects gets bigger. 
                </p>
                <p class="reflection__text">
                    Using BEM made my approach more structured and modular, and helped me keep my code more 
                    organized and predictable. Instead of using names like .button-blue, I swapped them with 
                    .card__button with a possible --modifier, which made it much clearer what element I was working with 
                    and where to find it within my code. 
                </p>
                <p class="reflection__text">
                    Sometimes the naming conventions of BEM can be repetitive. Personally, I like the consistency and clarity it 
                    provides. It makes debugging easier and helped me write more reusable and scalable CSS. Before using BEM, I 
                    stumbled into some deeply nested selectors that sometimes created specificity issues and tangled code. 
                </p>
                <p class="reflection__text">
                    Overall, learning to apply BEM into my projects was one of the most valuable takeaways from this 
                    assignment. It gave me an easier approach to managing bigger projects, and I plan to continue using it 
                    in future projects.

                <h4 class="reflection__subheader">File structure</h4>
                <p class="reflection__text">
                    One of the most important things I have learned throughout this assignment was how important it is 
                    with a well structured and organized file structure. This helps with the development process, scalability, 
                    separation of concerns and most importantly structure. 
                </p>
                <p class="reflection__text">
                    After learning about the file structure, I have restructured my projects into folders and subfolders to 
                    separate the different aspects and parts of the projects. This setup helps a lot with making changes to 
                    specific parts of my projects without having to search through one CSS file to find it. When separating 
                    the different components and layout from the page specific styling, it helped me separate concerns, so 
                    when I wanted to change a specific component late in the process I could do it without any problem. This 
                    also made it easier to reuse my code, because when I add pages to my projects that includes for example 
                    buttons or links, I can use the same SASS files to create a more well rounded project that comes together 
                    nicely. Then I can also change directly in that subfolder, and all the buttons change on all websites, 
                    creating a more cohesive experience for the user. 
                </p>
                <p class="reflection__text">
                    This structure is something I am definetely implementing in the future. It will save me a lot of time, 
                    create a better structure and save me countless times of having to finely go through and check where the 
                    specific issue is and how to fix it.

            </div>
            <div>
                <h4 class="reflection__subheader">SCSS & SASS</h4>
                <p class="reflection__text">
                    One of the key improvements I learned during this, was switching from standard CSS to SCSS, or SASS. 
                    This helped me improve structure in my styling, while helping me improve readability and 
                    maintainability in my stylesheets. The use of nesting was particularly helpful for styling elements 
                    while keeping my code clean and easier to navigate. It greatly reduced repetition and visually grouped 
                    together styling for specific elements, which made it easier to read and change parts of the code. I also 
                    learned the importance of not overusing nesting, as it can become overly specific and hard to change later. 
                </p>
                <p class="reflection__text">
                    Using SCSS enabled me to create reusable parts of styling, such as cards, buttons, navigation and table in 
                    this project. It did not only save time, but also pushed me to create modular and reusable code. This helped 
                    me keep the design consistent throughout the website, but also when adding more pages and parts to my projects. 
                    Overall, learning to use SASS effectively was a significant improvement on my coding and how I 
                    approach styling, and is something I will definitely use this in future projects.

            <div>
                <h4 class="reflection__subheader">Modular and reusable code</h4>
                <p class="reflection__text">
                    Another major focus throughout this assigment was improving how I structure and write modular and reusable code. 
                    One of the biggest takeaways from this, is how I focus on writing code that can be reused in different parts 
                    and pages of my projects. This is something that will save me a lot of time in the long run, reduce errors and 
                    increase maintainability.  
                </p>
                <p class="reflection__text">
                    All the different aspects I have written about and learned, has guided me towards coding in a more modoular and 
                    reusable way. This means that I can make changes to individual components without accidentally affecting other 
                    parts of the project, and made it possible to reuse these components across different parts of my projects. I am 
                    now thinking about all these different aspects of my coding, which helps me improve as a developer and gives me 
                    tools that I can use in the future when projects and tasks gets more extensive. Thinking like this has improved 
                    my workflow and also prepared me for how to code when working in team environments, because then the different 
                    people can work on different parts of the project.
