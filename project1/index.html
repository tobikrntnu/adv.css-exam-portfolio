                The feedback of what I needed to improve from the oblig, were divided into three main parts.
                Firstly, that it was better to import all SASS files into one main scss file, and then 
                only link that file into the HTML. I added a main.scss, and imported all the 
                partial SASS files into that so that I only had to compile that one file. 
            </p>
            <p class="reflection__text">
                The second was that I had to remove all commented-out or unused code. This was an easy fix, 
                so I removed all the code that was commented out.
