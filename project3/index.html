            <p class="reflection__text">
                Here is some of the feedback we recieved from the original project:
            </p>
            <ul class="reflection__list">
                <li>Add a title</li>
                <li>Missing red thread / lead the user</li>
                <li>More text explaining what is happening</li>
                <li>Show you can click button</li>
                <li>Maybe explain answers for the questions</li>
                <li>Present the UN goal its connected to</li>
                <li>Add final message / take action</li>
                <li>Maybe add a return button (to the top)</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="reflection__text">
                After recieving the initial feedback from the group version of the project, I identified many 
                different areas that needed improvements. This was to make the experience more interactive, 
                connected the the UN sustainable development goal it was based on and made the goal clearer for 
                the user. In the task description, it said to maybe use JS libraries like GSAP and sectionObserver, 
                but our project was structured in a way that made it very difficult to implement these changes. I 
                therefore decided to revamp the whole structure of the project, while still keeping the same story and 
                goal to make a better implementation of interactive features and a more complete experience for the users.
            </p>
            <p class="reflection__text">
                For the group assignment, my main contributions were making the pop-up modals for the questions, 
                while also making several parts for the main scrollytelling story like the structuring of the 
                sections, the trees, helping with the opening and closing section, the fabric and the airplane with 
                the animation.
            </p>
            <p class="reflection__text">
                As I said earlier, I restructured the whole assignment. I tried to fix all the feedback revieced from 
                the first assignment. I added GSAP and sectionObserver, added a title, tried to lead the user through 
                the website with a red thread. I had information throughout the website with a quiz that tests some of 
                that knowledge. I presented the UN development goal in the intro section, and added more text that 
                explicitly says that the user can click the different elements. I also added a final message at the 
                end of the website with a return button back to the top of the page. 
            </p>
            <h3 class="reflection__subheader">General reflection and learning outcomes</h3>
            <p class="reflection__text">
                I have used a lot from the later projects in the improvements of this. I made partial scss files and 
                had one file for each section to separate concerns and import them all into a main.scss file. I made 
                variables and used clamps for fluid typography to make the text scale automatically. I also used BEM 
                naming methodology and SCSS, which is something I am implementing for all my projects in the future. 
                For this project, I did not separate the different objects (like cards or buttons), because I felt like 
                it was not necessary or really natural in this project.         
            </p>
            <p class="reflection__text">
                From this project, I have learned a lot about using different scrollytelling and animations methods to 
                create a scrollytelling story. I have learned more about JS functions like GSAP and sectionObserver, while 
                also learning how to create a quiz modal that pops up when clicked. I have for the first time tried the 
                prefers-reduced-motion feature to make some edits for users that prefers reduced motion. I have learned more 
                about CSS animations and usage of variables to maintain consistent and modular code. 
            </p>
            <p class="reflection__text">
                Accessibility was a key focus for this project. I added reduced motion feature, while also trying to have 
                good color contrast by using variables to meet accessibility standards and make the website more pleasant 
                for more people. In my reimplementation, I focused on providing more text and navigation for the user to 
                hint and guide them through the website. This will make the website more usable for people with different 
                challenges. I also tried to focus on a good semantic structure and content to help people with screen 
                readers and other difficulties.
            </p>
            <p class="reflection__text">
                The projects content is strongly connected to the UN sustainable development goals, and with this website 
                I tried to raise awareness of this important topic. For people with computers and internet (the people that 
                actually can view the website), this topic is very relevant and that is why we (and I) focused on this issue.
            </p>
            <p class="reflection__text">
                For future improvements, I would maybe add different functions like light/dark mode. I would explore more and 
                different animations and interactions for getting to the different sections to make the website have a bit more 
                variety and nicer to go through. I could also have separated some of the different parts, and made partial SCSS 
                files for the different objects within the project for even more scalability. This would also help me to write 
                more structured code and better maintainability.
